# Intuitive Month 1 – C++ & Robotics Foundations

This repository documents my Month 1 learning journey toward becoming a
robotics engineer focused on **medical and surgical robotics** (e.g. da Vinci systems).

The goal of this month is to build a **strong foundation in modern C++**,
real-time programming concepts, and robotics fundamentals that are required
for safety-critical robotic systems.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn modern C++ (C++17/20)
- Develop disciplined software engineering and Git practices
- Build intuition for real-time and embedded systems
- Prepare for robotics and surgical robot development roles

---

## 📚 Learning Focus (Month 1)
- C++ language fundamentals
- Memory and data types
- Control flow and program structure
- Clean coding and version control discipline
- Robotics-oriented software thinking
